Metadata management
--------------------

AWS Glue 
	1. Maintain /Discover the metadata
	
You can generate the metadata manually / via crawler.



Create a Data warehouse solution using Server-based Architecture
================================================================

Redshift

Lab1: Using automobile dataset
-------------------------------
1. LOad the auto-data.csv into S3 ( dataset268726/automobile/auto-data.csv)

2. Use Glue Crawler to detect the metadata for the dataset

	15 mins :) Complete the above two steps.





3. Create Redshift Cluster
	- Go to Redshift Dashboard
	- Click on Create Cluster 
	- Follow the on-screen instructions to create the cluster. Ensure you set the username           and password and remember the same to login whenever required

4. Create an IAM Role for performing the queries in redshift

	Data: S3 (ReadWrite)
	Metadata: Glue (Read)
		
		- Go to IAM Dashboard and create an IAM role > Click on Role
		- Select Redshift > Redshift - Customizable
				
			 AWSGlueConsoleFullAccess
			 AmazonS3FullAccess

4. We will access the Query Editor of Redshift to perform queries
		
	- Go to Redshift Dashboard > Editor > Query Editor
	- Connect to a database to run queries and view results.
		Click on Connect to Database > GIve the following Information
			Database Name: dev
			Database username : awsuser
	
5. Once connected, you need to create a external schema (metadata - Glue , data - S3 in AWS space)

	CREATE external schema automobile from data catalog
	database 'automobile'
	iam_role 'arn:aws:iam::360304535068:role/redshiftRoles'
	region 'us-east-1'


Once the schema is created, ensure you have the table reflecting during schema selection. 

Perform queries
select * from automobile.automobile limit 5;



When the cluster is created, the default database that is used is

	Default DB: dev
	Default DB User: awsuser
	Password: Passw0rd
